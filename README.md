# AFK-AHK

> [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is required in order to execute this script in Destiny 2. Many mouse software apps like Razer Synapse can create macros that will accomplish the same thing. This is intended for users who do not have the functionality in their mouse software or want a script that is more universal and flexible to use.

## How-To-Use

1. Install AutoHotKey v2 by visiting [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Double click (open) on the script to start script
3. Open Destiny 2 (if u already open it, go step 4)
4. Executing the Script press `F3`
5. Exit script press `F4`

At this point, the script is loaded but is not executing the events until you hit a hotkey.
- Open Destiny 2 first (be cause script only target destiny 2)
- Start executing, `F3`.
- To completely shut down the script, hit `F4`.
- IMPORTANT: run destiny 2 in 1920x1080, and let it full screen or windowed fullscreen

## Disclaimer
~~I have not thoroughly tested if this is capable of fooling Destiny 2's AFK Kicker. I will adjust the steps until I am confident it works.~~
As of 28/10/24, this is confirmed working in Vanguard Strikes, NF, Onslaught
As of 12/03/25, this is confirmed working in all script i created
...

Those scripts use a simple mouse move to click around coordinates, but they work both for an AFK and a checkpoint bot. 
Also, they are easy examples for someone who wants to build a bot checkpoint for themselves.
